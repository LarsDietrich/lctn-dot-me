LCTN.ME is a portal that aggregates location based information into a single place. You select a point on the planet and information is loaded relative to that point. You can then "share" this location with people via the social links supplied.
</p>
<p>
We support the following location based information
</p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter - Shows all the tweets in the area, where people have opted to add location.</li>
<li>Streetview (Google) - Shows you what the place looks like at street level. Not available everywhere but awesome where it is.</li>
<li>Wikipedia - Shows you any wikipedia articles in the area. </li>
<li>Places - Shows points of interest in the area, and how many people have visited (or "checked in") to the place, based on Foursquare Places. </li>
<li>Webcams - Shows webcams available in the area. </li>
<li>Local - Some general information about the area, like weather, you current coordinates and local time.</li>
<li>Directions - Displays a route from point A to point B.</li>
<li>Photos - Shows pictures from Flickr, Instagram and Panoramio in the area.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The layout of the site is designed to enable enabling and disabling of information windows allowing you to customize the dashboard for whatever you're interested in seeing.

<b>What it isn't!</b>
<br/>
<p>
This site gathers various bits of information from different location information providers out there. It's intention is not, and never will be, to replace the functionality of these sites entirely. This portal should rather be seen as a consolidation of the core functionality from these providers in one easy to use place with enough functionality to be useful. An example of this is the Google Map, it does not do nearly as much as the full Google Map site does, but that's by design. It allows you to choose a location (with different views) and zoom in and out, thats it. If you would like the full experience I suggest using the Google Map site itself.
</p>
<p>
There's a nice feedback button on the site that I recommend you use should you have any ideas of your own, I'd like to grow this into a useful location information portal and I think I can do this with your help. Your feedback will help design the site so go ahead and let me know what you want (or don't want!)

<p>Thanks</p>
